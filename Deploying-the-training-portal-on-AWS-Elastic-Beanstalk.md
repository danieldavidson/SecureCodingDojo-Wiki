Before you begin you must have a running environment of the training portal with `config.js` configured and authentication configured either via local, Slack or Google or a combination.

Check the page on `Deploying the training portal on CentOS` for an example on configuring a local environment.

### Setting up an RDS database

First step is to configure a MySQL RDS database for the training portal. You can configure this database in an existing VPC or create a new VPC for this purpose.
